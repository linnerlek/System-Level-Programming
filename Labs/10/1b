strlen()
calculates the length of a string.
example with parameter and return value
char str[] = "This is a string";
size_t len = strlen(str);
The output would be 16 since it counts the letters and spaces.

strncmp()
compares a number of characters from two strings
example with parameter and return value
char str1[] = "flowers";
char str2[] = "trees";
int result = strncmp(str1, str2, 5);
compares the first 5 characters of str1 and str2
output would be a positive integer because the first character of str1 isnt equal to str2

strncpy()
copies a specific number of characters from one string to another
example with parameters and output
char start[] = "Hello there";
char finish[5];
strncpy(finish, start, 5);
output would be Hello since we copy the first 5 characters

strncat()
appends a specific amount of characters from one string to the end of another string
example with parameters and output
char finish[100] = "Hello";
char start[] = " there";
strncat(finish, start, 7);
now finish will contain "Hello there"
