After running the diff command on fopen_example.c and popen_example.c, I noticed that the main differences are about switching from using fopen to popen for I/O operations. The popen example shows how to execute a shell command instead of opening a specific file, and the error messages reflect that change. I expected some differences, but I was surprised by how straightforward the updates wereâ€”just a few lines adjusted to switch from file handling to process handling
